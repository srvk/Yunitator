This is the location of the unified Yunitator and Noisemes scripts. 
The script that is called by the tools in the launcher folder of DiViMe is yunified.py.
It uses the resources in either the Yunitator or OpenSAT directories, depending on which tools is run.
Currently many (possibly all) of the shared resources are in the top level directory.
There may be deprecated scripts and resources in the OpenSAT and Yunitator folders.
